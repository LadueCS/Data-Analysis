    "### What is Web-Scraping?\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of using scripts or bots to extract content and data from a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especillay useful in gathering data from the internet, when web APIs aren't available.\n",
    "- An API, or Application Programming Interface, is an interface that defines how different software would interact with each other. For example google maps has an API so that you don't have to web-scrape for programs to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web-Scraping primarily works by 'parsing' html code.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is how web-pages are encoded. They allow for the information on a page to be displayed on any size screen when they are read and decoded by a web-browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for us to web-scrape, we first need to understand some of the basics of HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML in a Nutshell\n",
    "Let's start by looking at a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"html_basic_example.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each part of a page is defined by a 'tag'. Tags come in pairs, the opening tag has the form  < _ > and the closing tag has the form </ _ >\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many differnt kinds of tags, with many different meanings, here are some of the common ones you'll run into:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tag  | Use |\n",
    "|:---:|:---|\n",
    "| < html > | The root of the page, gives the browswer a starting point |\n",
    "| < head > | Contains elements describing the document |\n",
    "| < body > | Defines the main body of the page, within it will be all the images, tables, lists, paragraphs, etc. |\n",
    "| < p > |Paragraph, contains standard text |\n",
    "| < li > | Defines list elements |\n",
    "| < a > | stands for anchor, contains a link to another page. Takes the form < a href=\"...\"> Statements... < /a> |\n",
    "| < div > | Divides sections in a page, used as a container for html elements |\n",
    "| < tr > | Holds row of data in a table format, used as a container for td elements |\n",
    "| < td > | Holds data in a \"cell\" within an HTML table | \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pages will have many tags nested in one another, and it can be intimidating to navigate at first. Fortunatly, web browswers make it easy to study the html. Open any web-site in another page, highlight anything you want to see the html source of, right-click, and select \"inspect\" or \"inspect element\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This will bring up the html source the page is using. Running your mouse over the code will highlight what it produces on the screen\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times elements will have 'Attributes' :\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"html_attribute_example.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'a' tag tells us the image of the wikipedia symbol is actually a link to the main page, with attributes of a 'title', 'class', and 'href' (or hyperlink reference, that gives the url the image links to)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use these attributes to search for elements within the html using a web-scraping package called 'Beautiful Soup'"
